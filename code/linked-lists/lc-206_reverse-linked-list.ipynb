    "* Have three pointers, `prev`, `curr`, and `nxt`, where `prev` is initialized to `None`\n",
    "* Then have a loop to run as long as `nxt` exists\n",
    "  * This will exit us out of the loop when we hit tail, because tail's next node is a None, and we do want the tail to be the last node that we return\n",
    "  * Inside this loop, point `curr.next` to `prev`, and move `prev`, `curr`, and `nxt` all to the next position\n",
    "* Lastly, because we exit when `curr` got placed onto the tail node, we have to set `curr.next` to `prev`\n",
    "  * Meaning, point the next node from the tail node to the previous node, and return the tail node as the new head"
