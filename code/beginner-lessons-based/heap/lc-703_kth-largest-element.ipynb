    "* We will create a MinHeap and maintain it to have only up to k-elements\n",
    "* This way we know that the first element (smallest) is the k-th largest because everything \"before\" it was of smaller value\n",
    "* And when we encounter a value that's larger than the current smallest value, we pop this value and push this new value into the MinHeap\n",

    "* $O(n\\log{n})$ for initial construction\n",
    "  * In the first construction, we would spend O(n) for the first heapify construction\n",
    "  * Then in the \"popping\" phase where we reduce down to `k` elements, it's $O((n-k)\\log{n'})$ where $n'$ is $n-1$, $n-2$, $n-3$, ..., $k+$1, which are both bounded by $O(n log (n))$\n",
    "  * Since $O(n\\log{n})$ is greater than $O(n)$, we take the former as the leading time complexity\n",
    "* `log(k)` in the streaming phase as we add to the heap\n",
