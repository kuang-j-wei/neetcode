    "* Then we increment from the start of the array up to right before this pivot value\n",

    "* Then at last when the iteration reaches the end, we put the pivot value to where the `p` pointer is\n",
    "* This works because then we are guaranteed that everything to the left of this `p` indeed is smaller than the pivot value. The `p` pointer serves a job of logging where the pivot value should eventually be placed\n",
    "* We then repeat this process until the current pivot is equal to `n - k` (which is when the kth largest value falls exactly on the current pivot pointer); And we only run the quick sort loop on the portion of the array that's larger or smaller than the current pivot, depending on whether `n - k` falls to the right or to the left of the current pivot\n",

    "* On average by chance, the pivot point should fall into roughly halfway of this array\n",
    "* So the iterations we need to do go like $n + \\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{n}{4} + \\frac{n}{8} + ...$ which equals to $2n$\n",
    "* So the time complexity is $O(2n) = O(n)$ on average\n",
    "* But if we are unlucky, the pivot could end up always being the largest number until we find the target index value\n",
